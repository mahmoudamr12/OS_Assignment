hello doctor, the code is run on 5 forms, 
form1: user enters the total number of resources for the program
form2: user enters maximum values for each process
form3: user enters available resources for each resource
form4: user enters the currently allocated data for each process
form5: user enters which process requests which resource and how much of the resource is needed
after checking for safety, the program prints on the screen if it's safe to give the process the requested resource or not.
